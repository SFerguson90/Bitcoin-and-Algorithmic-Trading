## Objective

 The objective of our group is to create an algorithmic trading strategy, using Python/JupyterNotebook and the Alpaca API, which will monitor assets and make trades according to a momentum strategy. We will then leverage our algorithmic trading strategy as a service, which investors may take advantage of, through the purchasing of our tokens on a blockchain network. 

## Challenges
